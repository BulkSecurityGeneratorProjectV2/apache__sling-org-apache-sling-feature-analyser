# Feature Model Analyser

The Analyser can analyse a feature for completeness, to ensure all requirements are satisfied by capabilities. The analyser is pluggable and can also perform other checks.

The analyser can be run from the commandline by running the following main class:

```
java org.apache.sling.feature.analyser.main.Main
```
